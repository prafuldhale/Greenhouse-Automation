# Greenhouse-Automation


> "Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals & happiness"  
>   giving a motivation from above quotes we dedcide to build a project related to Farming. After some research, we decide to build a Greenhouse and automate them using

## General Info
We build an **Automated Greenhouse System** by using different Sensors. 
In this project, we build a two modules
  1. Smart Irrigation.
  2. Weather Controlling.
  3. Monitoring
###### 1. Smart Irrigation
While building this system, We use a Soil moistoisture sensor

###### 2. Weather Controlling
In this project, for controlling a weather we have to maintain a temperature inside a Greenhouse. To achive a purpose Exhaust Fan and Filament Bulb is used.

###### 3. Monitoring
All the parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Moisture of soil are shown in Website. all screenshots are below.

## Features

The sensors will automate the watering system and weather conditions that farmers were doing manually. The system will work automatically in any condition (summer, winter, rainy).
